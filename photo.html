<br>Why is playing important? 
<br>Play is so essential for child development around the world that the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights recognizes it as a right of every child. Play is critical for kids to develop the emotional, social and creative thinking skills they’ll need when they’re adults.
<br> Play allows them to engage with their surrounding environment and with others in their community in a fun context. 
<br> It enables them to explore ideas and different ways to behave, testing their boundaries and growing in the process.

<br>The school library plays a great role in the life of students by serving as the store house of knowledge.
<br>The importance of a library in a  school cannot be over emphasized.
<br>While the role of the school library remains constant, its design, digital platform, strategies and tools could change as technology changes.

<center><h1>  CLASSROOMS </h1></center>
<p><h3>
<br>Classroom environment is one of the most important factors affecting student learning.
<br> Simply put, students learn better when they view the learning environment as positive and supportive .
<br> A positive environment is one in which students feel a sense of belonging, trust others, and feel encouraged to tackle challenges, take risks, and ask questions).
 <br>Such an environment provides relevant content, clear learning goals and feedback, opportunities to build social skills, and strategies to help students succeed 
 <br>"Creating a caring, child-centered environment takes lots of thought and planning," says fifth-grade teacher Frank Garcia.
 <br>"Basic bulletin boards are not enough. I believe in a very colorful classroom with posters, functional bulletin boards, and 
 <br>other 'interesting' items to enhance the environment, such as a small refrigerator, TV, and a stereo system with a CD player."
